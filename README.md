# OF_Grad_Shafranov

WORK IN PROGRESS
- This code provides a simplified implementation for solving the Grad-Shafranov equation in a Tokamak Fusion Reactor.
- The code leverages the Message Passing Interface (MPI) using the mpi4py library to distribute the computation across multiple processes.
- Psi (the poloidal flux function is iteratively solved using a parallelized relaxation method.
